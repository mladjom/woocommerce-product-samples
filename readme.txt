Sell or Give Samples of WooCommerce Products.

== Description ==

This plugin enables your to promote your products by offering samples of woocommerce products.

Giving away stuff for free or selling them cheap might seem counterintuitive – but it’s actually a practical business strategy that carries big payoffs in the long run.

What more, the sample products are just products, so you can apply all the shipping and inventory rules. And this even works for digital goods.

There are also options to exclude sample products from shop and category pages, position, style and change add to cart button text.
